## Blockchain and Ethereum Essentials

What will we learn from this section, here it is:
1. What is Blockchain
[Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a decentralized (peer-to-peer) way to store the data (or transactions) that used some blocks and it's chained. What this mean? So, the data that we store to the networks group or somewhere(networks, cloud, internet or intraned) will be bound with the previous data that store to the same networks. And the bound itself called chain. The chain that we create needs some computing power that used to run cryptoraphic process, so the data can'e be changed by one single entity, it's immutable (avoid double spending).
